Creating checkpoint camps every few floors to start deeper (marc sagt lieber nicht)

Maybe inherit one item from your previous character

Underground merchant "moleman" random appearance

Descension and Ascension, descend holes with keys and ascend again with a rope.

Tower layout might be generated once upon run start and stays the same until run ends

Surface shop available at the start of each Descension run. Surface shop has extra hearts and better starting gear on offer.

Ascension can secure accumulated funds for later runs but retires your character.
Auto Ascension maybe available but at a heavy cost.

Every 10 or so floors is a boss fight during Descension.

At certain floors an artifact will be found and an event (giant worm chasing you) will be triggered,
proccing an asenscion run to secure the artifact for good. (these usually unlock something once retrieved)
